### Adding New Piece Types
Edit the `pieceTypes` array in `src/components/PieceForm.tsx`:

```typescript
const pieceTypes = [
  { value: 'handbuilding', label: 'Handbuilding' },
  { value: 'painting', label: 'Painting' },
  { value: 'glaze', label: 'Glaze' },
  { value: 'wheel-throwing', label: 'Wheel Throwing' },
  // Add new types here
];
```

### Customizing Notifications
Modify notification templates in `src/services/notificationService.ts`:

```typescript
private emailTemplate = 'Your custom email template here...';
private smsTemplate = 'Your custom SMS template here...';
```

### Styling
